1. $match:

It is used to filter documents based on a condition.
It works exactly like the find() method but inside aggregation.
Only documents that satisfy the condition will move to the next stage.
For example: 
[
 { name:"Hiba", age:22 },
 { name:"Sara", age:25 }
]

db.users.aggregate([
 { $match:{ age:22 } }
])                          // only name Hiba document is returned.
