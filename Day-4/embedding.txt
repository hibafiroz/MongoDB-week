Document Embedding:

Storing related data directly within a documnt as nested objects or arrays.
It keeps all the information together which makes read very fast bcz MongoDB can fetch everything in one query without joining other collections.

When to Use Embedding:
1. Data is always accessed together:
If we always read the parent and child data in the same query, embedding is perfect.
Example: Blog post + its comments.

2. One-to-few relationship:
If there are only a few related items, it fits nicely inside a single document.
Example: User + a few addresses.

3. Document size stays reasonable:
MongoDB has a 16MB document size limit.
Embedding is good as long as adding child data won’t make the document grow too large.

Document References:

Referencing means storing only an ID of the related document instead of storing the full related data inside the document.
The documents stay separate, but they remain connected through this reference.
It’s useful then the related data is large or reused or wanna update individeually

When to Use References:
1. Many-to-Many Relationships:

2. Large or Frequently Changing Data:
Referenced data lives in its own document, so updates touch only that document.
This makes operations faster and avoids rewriting the parent document.

3. Data Accessed Independently:
If the child is often accessed without the parent, it deserves its own collection.
ex:A list of products accessed by many parts of the app, not just the user page.
