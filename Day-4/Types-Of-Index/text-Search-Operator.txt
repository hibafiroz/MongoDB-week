MongoDB Text Search Operators:

MongoDB provides text search operators to perform and control text-based searching on string fields that have a text index.
These operators are used inside the $text operator.


1. $text:
It enables text search in a query.
$text tells MongoDB to perform a text-based search
It works only on collections that have a text index
Without a text index, $text queries will fail

Syntax:
{ $text: { ... } }
$text is mandatory for all text search operations.


2. $search:
It specifies the search string (words or phrases).
It contains the actual text to search
MongoDB searches for these words in all fields included in the text index
By default, multiple words are treated as OR

Types of search supported:
> Single word search    : Single word search returns all documents containing that word.
> Multiple word search  : Multiple word search returns documents that contain any of the searched words (uses OR logic).
> Exact phrase search   : Phrase search returns documents only if the exact sequence of words appears together (Uses AND logic).
> Excluding words       : Documents containing excluded words prefixed with - are removed from the result.

Examples:
$search: "developer"
$search: "backend developer"
$search: \"full stack developer\" : This matches "Looking for a full stack developer" NOT "Developer with full stack skills"
$search: "developer -junior"

Multiple Phrase Search (OR behavior):
$search: "\"final exam\" \"library rules\""
MongoDB search for documents that match EITHER of these phrases:
the exact phrase “final exam”
OR the exact phrase “library rules”



3. $language:
It controls the stemming rules used during text search.
language is for specifying the language,
stemming happens because of the language.

Examples of stemming:
running → run
developers → develop

Syntax : $language:"spanish"
Default language is english if not specified.

When we write : $language: "english"
MongoDB : uses English stemming rules and uses English stop words


4. $caseSensitive:
It controls whether text search is case-sensitive.
Default value: false
When false, uppercase and lowercase letters are treated the same
When true, exact case matching is required

Example:
$caseSensitive: true
Effect : Developer ≠ developer


5. $diacriticSensitive:
It controls accent (diacritic) sensitivity.
Diacritics are special marks on characters
Default value: false
When false, accents are ignored
When true, accents must match exactly

Example:
café ≠ cafe   (when true)
Syntax : $diacriticSensitive:true

Combined Example:
db.collection.find({
  $text: {
    $search: "developer",
    $language: "english",
    $caseSensitive: false,
    $diacriticSensitive: false
  }
})
