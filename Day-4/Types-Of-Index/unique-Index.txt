Unique Index:

A unique index ensures that the indexed field cannot contain duplicate values across the entire collection.
Unique is NOT a separate index type
It is an option that can be applied to most index types

> Why Unique Index is Used?
To enforce data integrity
To prevent duplicate values at the database level

Syntax
db.collection.createIndex(
  { fieldName: 1 },
  { unique: true }
)
Example
db.users.createIndex(
  { email: 1 },
  { unique: true }
)

This tells MongoDB:
“No two documents in this collection can have the same email.”

If a document with an existing value is inserted:
{ email: "test@gmail.com" }

MongoDB:
Rejects the insert
Throws an error:
E11000 duplicate key error

> If two doc contain nothing in email field (null), It is considered as duplicate
{ email: null }
{ email: null }
NOT allowed with a unique index bcz MongoDB treats null as a value

> Field is missing (not present at all)
{ name: "A" }
{ name: "B" }
❌ Also NOT allowed by default
Reason:
Missing fields are indexed as null
