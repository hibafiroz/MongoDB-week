1. Single Index:
Its an index created on one field only like name or age or etc. 
MongoDB sorts that field in the index so it can find values faster.

If collection is:
db.users.insertMany([
  { name: "Hiba", age: 22 },
  { name: "Aisha", age: 25 },
  { name: "Sara", age: 20 }
])
Creating a single-field index on age:
db.users.createIndex({ age: 1 })


2. Compound Index:
A compound index is an index on more than one field at the same time, like name + age or category + price. 
It’s built in a specific order, and that order matters.

db.products.insertMany([
  { category: "Cosmetics", price: 200, name: "Lipstick" },
  { category: "Cosmetics", price: 150, name: "Eyeliner" },
  { category: "Perfume", price: 1500, name: "Aqua Mist" }
])

db.products.createIndex({ category: 1, price: 1 })
